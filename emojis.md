# How to properly input an emoji in the emoji input?
Once your popup is properly initialised, go to the second feature and start completing it:
- Choose content for the first input
- Type boom for the second input
- Choose react for the third input
- And type **one** emoji on the fourth input *(In this example, we chose ðŸ’¥)*

That's it! If you know check the feature and click on "Update changes", messages in the channel containing the word boom will have an explosion reaction underneath it.

# What if I want to send a custom emoji?
- Inside discord, type the custom emoji you want to use.
- Then, add a backslash (`\`) before the emoji, and send the message.
Something like this should appear : `<:YourEmoji:123456789987654321>`
- In this thing, copy only the `YourEmoji:123456789987654321` part and paste it in the emoji input.

That's it again!
